Once the temperature has been reached, add the citric acid (or lemon juice) and stir well. You should already see the citric acid react with the milk/whey.
Heat it up to 90°C
Pour the ricotta in the cheesecloth and let the whey drip.
Move the ricotta into the cheese recipient.
Store in the fridge.</p><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_basic href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/basic>Basic</a> &#183; <a id=tag_italian href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/italian>Italian</a> &#183; <a id=tag_cheesefare href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/cheesefare>Cheesefare</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
