For the meatballs:

how many meatballs you make, which depends on how big you want to make the
meatballs. You get the idea.</li><li>Take a cheese cube and wrap with enough ground meat to completely cover it.
Repeat this process until you&rsquo;ve run out of the ground beef mix.</li><li>Heat the frying pan, add some olive oil, and add the meatballs. Cook over
medium heat rolling the meatballs from time to time until they are slightly
brown from all sides (wait, spheres have no sides).</li><li>When the meatballs look done, pour the water and tomato paste; add the dried
