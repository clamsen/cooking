Life will be easier if you can place the spices in a tea strainer of sorts, otherwise, it&rsquo;s not the worst thing in the world fishing them out later on.</li><li>Add beef bouillon cubes, diced beef, fish/oyster sauce, and honey/sugar, then simmer for a couple hours with the lid on.</li><li>Cook the rice noodles (should only take a few minutes, just until the texture is al dente enough).</li><li>Once the broth is done cooking, fish out the spices that you added at step 2. It&rsquo;s worth doing this rather than accidentally chewing on a bit of star anise, trust me.</li><li>Cut up coriander and spring onions as garnish.</li><li>Add rice noodles to bowl, followed by the broth and its contents, followed by the garnish. This can be made and eaten within 1 hour if you want it quickly, but typically with broths the longer you simmer the tastier it&rsquo;ll be.</li></ol><h2>Contributor(s)</h2><ul><li><a href=https://jonburga.com>Jon Burga</a><ul></ul></li></ul><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_vietnamese href=https://based.cooking/tags/vietnamese>Vietnamese</a> &#183; <a id=tag_beef href=https://based.cooking/tags/beef>Beef</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://based.cooking/>https://based.cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
