It is fine to butcher the chicken to reduce its size, but include all bones and tendons as well.</li><li>Add any aromatic seasonings.</li><li>Fill the pot with water up slightly past all the ingredients.</li><li>Bring contents to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for at least 45 minutes.</li><li>You may want to remove with a spoon or other instrument the bubbles that form on the top. This will give you a clearer stock, but it is not necessary.</li><li>Strain the liquid, now stock, into another container for storage or use.</li></ol><p>You may also eat the remaining chicken, possibly for lunchmeat, but since it has imparted its flavor to the stock, it will be slightly more bland so some seasoning might be advised.
You may eat or compost the remaining vegetables.</p><h2>Contributor(s)</h2><ul><li><a href=https://lukesmith.xyz>Luke Smith</a><ul></ul></li></ul><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_chicken href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/chicken>Chicken</a> &#183; <a id=tag_stock href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/stock>Stock</a> &#183; <a id=tag_basic href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/basic>Basic</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
