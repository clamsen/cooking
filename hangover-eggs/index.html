I&rsquo;ve dabbled with the egg:bread ratios, and this seems to work.</li><li>Once the olive oil starts smelling a bit (or smoke comes off of it), crack in however many eggs you care to eat. Turn down the heat to medium.</li><li>Act fast! As the eggs start cooking, prepare a plate with two handfuls of chopped green onion and Tabasco.</li><li>After about four minutes (or when the tops of the eggs start to set), take out eggs and place on top of bed of onions & Tabasco.</li><li>Turn heat back to medium-high and add a touch more olive oil. Place pieces of bread in pan.</li><li>Every so often, move the pieces of bread around to soak up the oil.</li><li>When the bread is about to turn a good shade of golden-brown, add a generous sprinkle of Tony Chachere&rsquo;s to the plated eggs (on top of them).</li><li>Turn off the heat and move the pan off the burner. Take out bread pieces and place on the same plate as the eggs.</li><li>Serve with glass of ice-cold beer.</li></ol><p>Ideally, you won&rsquo;t even need a fork! Simply use the bread to guide the eggs on top of each piece, break the yolk into the piece, and take a large
bite.</p><div id=nextprev><a href=/cooking/japanese-noodle-soup/><div id=prevart>Previous:<br>Japanese Noodle Soup</div></a><a href=/cooking/fried-potatoes/><div id=nextart>Next:<br>Fried Potatoes</div></a></div><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_eggs href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/eggs>Eggs</a> &#183; <a id=tag_snack href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/snack>Snack</a> &#183; <a id=tag_quick href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/quick>Quick</a> &#183; <a id=tag_cheesefare href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/cheesefare>Cheesefare</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a><br><br><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/index.xml><img src=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/rss.svg style=max-height:1.5em alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates."></a></footer></body></html>
