Add honey (use as much as you want, I wouldn&rsquo;t use less than two tablespoons though) and stir. Turn the stove to medium-high.</li><li>Let that sit for a few minutes to let the flavors get to know each other a bit, then stir in a few spoonfuls of flour to thicken the sauce.</li><li>Once the sauce has reached your preferred level of thickness take it off the heat. Serve over rice.</li></ol><div id=nextprev><a href=/cooking/ginger-garlic-broccoli/><div id=prevart>Previous:<br>Broccoli with Ginger and Garlic Sauce</div></a><a href=/cooking/red-sauce/><div id=nextart>Next:<br>Red Sauce (Ragu all'Italiana)</div></a></div><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_asian href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/asian>Asian</a> &#183; <a id=tag_chicken href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/chicken>Chicken</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a><br><br><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/index.xml><img src=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/rss.svg style=max-height:1.5em alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates."></a></footer></body></html>
