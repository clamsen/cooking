With a sharp and preferably short-bladed knife make an incision from the anus to just between the two small fins under the head. This is best done by inserting the knife blade tip facing up while putting force upwards and moving towards the head, letting gravity do the work. This helps to avoid puncturing the organs.</li><li>Remove the organs. Gently pull and cut the membrane that connects each to the rest of the body.</li><li>Make an incision around the mouth (the hard &rsquo;lips&rsquo;), turn the fish around and do the same to that side.</li><li>Start to slowly but firmly pull back the skin cutting whenever there is resistance as you make your way towards the tail.</li><li>Once you have removed the skin, flip it back onto its back and cut off the thin flabs of meat of its underside and fins from the body. At this point there should be a clear distinction between the body and the larger head. Behead the animal.</li><li>With a filleting knife, fillet the meat from the backbone and remove the tail.</li><li>You should be left with 2 long strips of meat. Cut each in half.</li></ol><h3 id=cooking>Cooking</h3><ol start=8><li>In a pan on medium heat, melt a good amount of butter and place the fillets inside. The goal here is to sear the meat to get that light crust. Flip until all sides have turned the &lsquo;golden brown&rsquo; color.</li><li>Add the herbs, just enough to cover the fillets, salt and pepper too if desired and cover with the lid on low heat until fully cooked. Time here varies but it can be anywhere between 5-10 minutes.</li><li>Enjoy. This goes well with steamed vegetables. Or potatoes to soak up the butter.</li></ol><p><img src=/cooking/pix/fried-anglerfish-fillet-01.webp alt=served></p><div id=nextprev><a href=/cooking/fried-potatoes/><div id=prevart>Previous:<br>Fried Potatoes</div></a><a href=/cooking/guacamole/><div id=nextart>Next:<br>Fresh Guacamole</div></a></div><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_fish href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/fish>Fish</a> &#183; <a id=tag_seafood href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/seafood>Seafood</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a><br><br><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/index.xml><img src=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/rss.svg style=max-height:1.5em alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates."></a></footer></body></html>
