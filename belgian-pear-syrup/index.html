You don&rsquo;t have to core or deseed the fruit; everything can go in the pot.</li><li>Place the fruit in a large pan with a thick bottom so you get even heat. I suggest you place the pears on the bottom, since they don&rsquo;t burn as fast. Add the glass of water.</li><li>If you are using them, add the dried fruits at this point.</li><li>Put the heat as low as possible and let it all slowly stew for 3 hours, stirring every now and then.</li><li>At this point, you can boil your glass jars to sterilize them. Place the sterilized jars on a clean, dry towel.</li><li>When the fruit is done cooking for 3 hours, grab your sieve or cheese cloth, and place it over a bowl, run your fruit through it until you have extracted all the clear liquid. You can discard the pulp.</li><li>Quickly rinse the pot with water until clean and add the fruit liquid back. Place back on the stove.</li><li>Add the sugar. Add a bit less sugar if you also used dried fruits.</li><li>Cook for another 2 hours. After that, stir every so often, Be careful with the stirring; if you stir too often, it might caramelize too quickly.</li><li>After two to two and a half hours, your syrup should be nearly done.</li><li>At this point, it&rsquo;s up to you on how thick you want your syrup to be. A good way to test the viscosity is to drop a little bit on a cold plate or on your countertop to see how it is at room temperature.</li><li>When you are happy with the viscosity, pour the syrup into your sterilized jars and immediately seal them.</li></ol><div id=nextprev><a href=/cooking/breakfast-wrap/><div id=prevart>Previous:<br>Breakfast Wrap</div></a><a href=/cooking/baked-mostaccioli/><div id=nextart>Next:<br>Baked Mostaccioli</div></a></div><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_syrup href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/syrup>Syrup</a> &#183; <a id=tag_fruit href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/fruit>Fruit</a> &#183; <a id=tag_belgian href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/belgian>Belgian</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a><br><br><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/index.xml><img src=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/rss.svg style=max-height:1.5em alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates."></a></footer></body></html>
