It should not boil, if it happens, set it aside, keep mixing and once the temperature lowers put it back on the heat.</li><li>Once the preparation gets thicker, be more careful and mix it more frequently so that it does not stick (and burn)
and lumps do not form.</li><li>Once you get a consistency similar to that of a custard, set it aside and keep mixind for 10 minutes, until it gets
cold and thickens a bit more. If you put a spoon inside, pass your finger in the middle and it does not unite anymore, it is done.</li><li>Once cold, put it on a glass jar and leave it in the fridge, or sterilize it.</li></ol><h2>Contributor(s)</h2><ul><li><a href=https://bernardoslongo.xyz>Bernardo Slongo</a><ul></ul></li></ul><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_argentinian href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/argentinian>Argentinian</a> &#183; <a id=tag_milk href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/milk>Milk</a> &#183; <a id=tag_slowcooked href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/slowcooked>Slowcooked</a> &#183; <a id=tag_traditional href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/traditional>Traditional</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
