For the standard medium-rare beef wellington, do not cook the fillet, just sear it, tough if you want something more cooked than medium-rare, it&rsquo;s wise to give it more heat here. Put it aside on a plate.</li><li>Brush the fillet with yellow mustard <em>immediatly</em> after taking it out of the pan. This allows the musturd&rsquo;s flavour to be absorbed by the fillet and thus preserve a mildly hot flavor.</li><li>Chop the mushrooms. Put them in a food processor. Transfer the pur√©e to a saut√© pan that has been heated to medium high heat to cook. Allow the mushrooms to release their moisture; once the moisture has been boiled away take the mushrooms out of pan to cool.</li><li>Lay out the slices of ham on plastic wrap and spread the mushroom mixture over the ham. Place the fillet in the middle. Wrap the fillet into a tight barrel shape twist the end of the plastic wrap to secure the wrap and the refrigerate the whole thing for 20 minutes.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 302¬∞F/150¬∞C.</li><li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out a sheet of puff pastry to a size that will fit the fillet. Preserve a little excess pastry. Unwrap the fillet-mushroom-ham from the plastic wrap and place in the middle of the pastry dough. Brush the edges of the pastry with the beaten egg yolks.</li><li>Place the pastry-wrapped thing on a baking tray. Brush the exposed surface again with the beaten eggs. Optionally, score the top of the pastry with a knife, to give it a better presentation. Scratch the surface of it but don&rsquo;t cut it through. Season it through with coarse salt.</li><li>Bake at 302¬∞F/105¬∞C for 35-42 minutes. The pastry should be nicely golden when done. Let it rest for about 10 minutes and cut it into 1in/2.54cm-thick slices for presentation.</li></ol><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_english href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/english>English</a> &#183; <a id=tag_beef href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/beef>Beef</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
