I believe the issue with coconut oil is it likes being cooked at lower temperatures or else the health quality of the oil will degrade.</li></ul><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_potato href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/potato>Potato</a> &#183; <a id=tag_snack href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/snack>Snack</a> &#183; <a id=tag_side href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/side>Side</a> &#183; <a id=tag_fasting href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/fasting>Fasting</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
