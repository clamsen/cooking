Store somewhere warm.</li><li>Day 2: the starter should be a bit bubbly. Feed the starter with 80g of water and 50g of flour and store again with loosely covered. If the starter doesn&rsquo;t have bubbles yet, wait another day.</li><li>Day 3-4: repeat the feeding process</li><li>You can now use the starter for baking sourdough bread. Remember to not use all the starter at once and feed the remaining starter to always have it available.</li><li>Storing the starter: store the starter in a closed container or jar in the fridge. The starter will survive almost indefinitely. After some time a vinegarish liquid forms on top of the starter. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of this, it is there to protect the starter from microbes. It can be poured away when you use the starter next time.</li><li>When using the starter after long storage you need to activate it again. Feed it 1-2 times and see if bubbles form. You can also test the activity by placing small part into a glass of water. An active starter will float.</li></ol><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_bread href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/bread>Bread</a> &#183; <a id=tag_sourdough href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/sourdough>Sourdough</a> &#183; <a id=tag_basic href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/basic>Basic</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
