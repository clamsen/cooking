Cut the turnips into bite sized pieces making sure to cut the top and bottom ends off first. If you can not find turnips with their greens still attached Mustard greens can be substituted.</li><li>Put the cut up turnips in the slow cooker and pour in the chicken stock.</li><li>Take the meat and dump it into the slow cooker drippings and all. If the amount of liquid looks a bit low to you, you can pour in another cup or so of water at your discretion.</li><li>Sprinkle more pepper over the soup and put the saffron in the bowl of warm water and let it seep for five minutes. Then dump it and the warm water into the soup.</li><li>Cut the stems off of the greens and then chop the greens vertically.</li><li>Cook the soup on high for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until the turnip and meat are soft and tender. About 20 minutes before it is to be done take the chopped greens and put them in the soup. Don&rsquo;t worry if it overfills the slow cooker, the greens will shrink a ton. Cook for about 20 minutes until done.</li><li>Taste the soup, if it&rsquo;s still too bland you can add spices of your choice and season to your taste.</li></ol><div id=nextprev><a href=/cooking/aussie-snags/><div id=prevart>Previous:<br>Aussie Snags (sausage sizzle)</div></a><a href=/cooking/full-english-breakfast/><div id=nextart>Next:<br>Full English Breakfast</div></a></div><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_beef href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/beef>Beef</a> &#183; <a id=tag_soup href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/soup>Soup</a> &#183; <a id=tag_roast href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/roast>Roast</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a><br><br><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/index.xml><img src=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/rss.svg style=max-height:1.5em alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates."></a></footer></body></html>
