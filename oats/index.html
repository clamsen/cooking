Use a 2:1 water-to-oats ratio (by volume) for rolled oats, 3:1 for
steel cut.</li><li>Boil on medium heat until most of the water has been absorbed/evaporated.
Rolled oats will be ready quicker than steel cut.</li><li>Pour over fruit in bowl (if having fruit).</li><li>Sprinkle cinnamon (if having cinnamon).</li><li>Mix.</li><li>Add a spoonful of peanut butter (if having peanut butter).</li></ol><h2 id=serving-sizes>Serving sizes</h2><p>You&rsquo;ll need less dry steel cut oats versus rolled oats for the same serving
size. My personal &ldquo;standard serving&rdquo; is 1/3 cup steel cut or 1/2 cup rolled
(note that, per the ratios above, both of these end up needing 1 cup water).</p><h2>Contributor(s)</h2><ul><li><a href=https://m-chrzan.xyz>Martin Chrzanowski</a><ul></ul></li></ul><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_sweet href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/sweet>Sweet</a> &#183; <a id=tag_breakfast href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/breakfast>Breakfast</a> &#183; <a id=tag_quick href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/quick>Quick</a> &#183; <a id=tag_fasting href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/fasting>Fasting</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
