breakfast to fill your HP and stamina bars for the day, I&rsquo;ve got just the
perfect recipe for you.</p><p>To be honest, this is more of a build-your-own dish. What I am providing here, I
would say, is more of a starting point and you&rsquo;re more than welcome to add (or
remove) anything you&rsquo;d like. I also have to say that this is not exclusively a
breakfast dish, I&rsquo;ve had it for breakfast, for lunch, for supper, for dinner,
etc. Although, I guess when you&rsquo;re a student just any food at any time of the
day will do.</p><h2 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h2><p>Since I more often than not cook this only for myself, the ingredient list below
is calculated for one person. Once more, this is not a strict ingredient list,
so you can really add anything you want. I would say that the only ingredients
that are a most are the eggs and the potatoes. The rest of the ingredients I
will mark with * for the ones that I usually use, and ** for ingredients that I
have used, but seldom use.</p><ul><li>2 eggs</li><li>2 small/medium-sized potatoes</li><li>Salt</li><li>Black pepper</li><li>4-6 bacon strips*</li><li>½ an onion*</li><li>Cheese (I usually use Gouda)*</li><li>Paprika*</li><li>A couple of Champignon &lsquo;shrooms**</li><li>Some slices of bell pepper**</li></ul><h2 id=directions>Directions</h2><ol><li>Cut the bacon into pieces and fry it on a pan.</li><li>Cut the potatoes into small cubes.</li><li>After frying the bacon, set aside and use the bacon grease to fry the
potatoes over medium/medium-low heat for about 20 minutes.</li><li>Add some salt and paprika to the potatoes, mix well and cook for another ten
minutes.</li><li>Cut the onions and add them to the frying pan. Cook for about five minutes.</li><li>If you decide to add some vegetables, like mushrooms or peppers, add them
now.</li><li>Now, there are two ways you can cook the eggs.*<ul><li>Beat the eggs in a bowl and the pour them onto the pan.</li><li>Or just crack the eggs directly on the mix in the pan and mix everything
thoroughly.</li></ul></li><li>Cut the cheese into small slices and add it.</li><li>Cook for a couple of minutes more, until eggs are cooked enough. Don&rsquo;t let
the eggs dry (unless that&rsquo;s the way you like your eggs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).</li><li>For the final touch, chop the parsley (or whatever other spices/herbs you
decided to use) and add it on top.</li><li>Serve hot and add some freshly ground pepper.</li></ol><p>*Personally, I prefer to beat the eggs first in a bowl before adding them to the
frying pan.</p><p>Originally published at <a href=https://www.yaroslavps.com/food/country-breakfast-skillet/>https://www.yaroslavps.com/food/country-breakfast-skillet/</a></p><h2>Contributor(s)</h2><ul><li><a href=https://www.yaroslavps.com/>Yaroslav de la Peña Smirnov</a><ul></ul></li></ul><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_american href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/american>American</a> &#183; <a id=tag_breakfast href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/breakfast>Breakfast</a> &#183; <a id=tag_pork href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/pork>Pork</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
