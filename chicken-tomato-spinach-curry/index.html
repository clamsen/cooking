Flip the chicken pieces regularly to prevent them from burning or overcooking.</li><li>Add your desired amount of curry powder to the frying chicken. Too much may be too salty or overwhelming so be sure to not overdo it.</li><li>As the chicken cooks through, dump all of your tomatoes and extra ingredients into a food processor and turn it all into a thin tomato paste. Add the paste to the curry directly. If you do not wish to use a food processor you can skin the tomatoes and add them to the curry anyway.</li><li>Add all of your wanted spinach, and don&rsquo;t be shy about doing so. At first it may seem like you are adding too much but it quickly shrivels up in the curry and you&rsquo;ll need to add more.</li><li>Make sure the chicken is cooked all the way through and serve.</li></ol><h2>Contributor(s)</h2><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/LukeGoule>Luke Goule</a><ul></ul></li></ul><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_curry href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/curry>Curry</a> &#183; <a id=tag_chicken href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/chicken>Chicken</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
