liquid you want the refried beans to be, you can use all or just some part of
the liquid inside the can. I usually get rid of some of the liquid from the
can before pouring the beans.</li><li>Mash the beans and mix. Let them fry at medium-low to medium heat for about 5
to 10 minutes, mixing from time to time.</li><li>Serve, and enjoy with some totopos.</li></ol><p>Originally published at <a href=https://www.yaroslavps.com/food/refried-beans/>https://www.yaroslavps.com/food/refried-beans/</a></p><div style=clear:both class=taglist>Related:<br><a id=tag_mexican href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/mexican>Mexican</a> &#183; <a id=tag_beans href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/beans>Beans</a> &#183; <a id=tag_fasting href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/tags/fasting>Fasting</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/>https://clamsen.github.io/cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
