Even if you buy thin crust that is already sold as &lsquo;super thin&rsquo; you have to make it even thinner. Make it so thin that you can fill 2 baking sheets with it (yes, you will make two large flammkuchen - since they are thin you need one per person) :) I take two pieces of parchment paper, put the dough in between and flatten it using a bottle (e.g. wine). It has to be as thin as possible (1-2 mm).</li><li>once the dough is flat, put it on your baking tray and preheat the oven at 450 to 500 Fahrenheit (230 to 260 Celsius)</li><li>distribute the sour cream evenly (it should be a very thin layer, just barely covering the dough</li><li>cut the onion and bacon into small pieces and distribute onion, bacon/vegetables (also in small pieces) evenly</li><li>put in the oven for 10 minutes and take it out when it is getting a bit dark. The thin parts will get a bit brown</li><li>put salt and pepper</li></ol><p>I usually take it down from the baking tray and let it cool down for 2-5 minutes before eating</p><h2>Contributor(s)</h2><ul><li><a href=https://eggerbernhard.ch>Bernhard Egger</a><ul></ul></li></ul><div style=clear:both class=taglist><a id=tag_french href=https://based.cooking/tags/french>French</a> &#183; <a id=tag_pork href=https://based.cooking/tags/pork>Pork</a> &#183; <a id=tag_quick href=https://based.cooking/tags/quick>Quick</a></div></article></main><footer><a href=https://based.cooking/>https://based.cooking/</a></footer></body></html>
